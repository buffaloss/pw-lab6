# Web Programming laboratory work no.6 - Front-end

# Description & flow of the app
Wander Whirl is a sleek travel destinations tracker designed for simplicity and ease of use. 

The app features a clean interface with a logo at the top and an introductory sentence. Users can add locations by clicking the "Add location" button, which opens a popup form. This form prompts users to enter the location name, description, and rating on a scale of 1 to 5 stars with 0.5 step increments.

Upon submission, the form closes, and users are returned to the main page where their entered location data is displayed in a card-like element. Each card showcases the location's details, allowing users to effortlessly keep track of their travel experiences.

Additionally, Wander Whirl offers a customizable viewing experience with a "Dark mode"/"Light mode" button located at the bottom of the page. This feature enables users to switch between different color themes to suit their preferences.
